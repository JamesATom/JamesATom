Hi there 👋
I'm a software developer from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, passionate about building robust backend systems and creative Telegram bots.

🔭 I’m currently working on Telegram bots for video trimming and processing, exploring advanced video handling features, and developing backend solutions with Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB.

🌱 I’m diving deeper into backend architecture, Kafka vs RabbitMQ, advanced TypeScript, video processing algorithms, and bot monetization strategies.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Telegram bots, video/media services, and backend API design.

🤔 I’m always up for discussions about scalable backend systems, message queues, advanced database structures, or anything around Node.js and video tech.

💬 Ask me about backend patterns, Telegram API integration, video processing, and backend growth strategies!

📫 How to reach me: Telegram or via GitHub issues.

⚡ Fun fact: I love swimming, exploring film history, experimenting with new tech stacks, and always have a new side project cooking.
